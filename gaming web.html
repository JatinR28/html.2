    <h2>about game</h2>
    <p>Violence is one factor that they try to imitate and there have been instincts where children have killed each other thinking that just like in games one needs to kill the other to win a difference of opinion.

        Video games are increasing on larger scales today and more and more kids are getting into the craze of playing these games. There are both good and bad games. The industry needs to make a thorough analysis and introduce games that are more innovative and useful so that the damage caused and behavioral patterns do not change, instead bring about good to the coming generations. Too much of gaming would definitely have an impact on people who play for long, the industry has to make sure that good games needs to be introduced, reducing the amount of violence or restricting to the age factor, so that bigger players who understand right from wrong could go for the more harsh games.</p>
